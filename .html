                        Tomato, along with pepper, potato, and eggplant, belong to the Solanaceae family of flowering plants. This family of plants are also known as nightshades. Nightshades include more than 3000 species including many that are economically important. Even though there are more than 7000 varieties of tomatoes, they all represent only one species of tomato that is cultivated, S. lycopersicum.&nbsp;Tomatoes have had several scientific names over the years including Solanum lycopersicum and Lycopersicon esculentum. Why the different names, you might ask? The reason for this has to do with how people thought tomatoes were related to other plants. In the early 1700s, Linnaeus put tomatoes in the genus Solanum based on their visible characteristics. In the mid-1700s, Philip Miller, another botanist, did not agree with Linnaeus' classification and instead placed tomatoes into the genus Lycopersicon. He thought that tomatoes belonged in a different genus from other poisonous nightshade species. More recently, taxonomists reclassified the species again, putting them back into the genus Solanum based genetic information. What this story about the classification of tomatoes goes to show is that scientific knowledge is not static, and that scientific knowledge constantly changes based on new information.</p>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7">Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year. Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.[2] Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals. Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once. The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 0.5–4 inches (1.3–10.2 cm) in width</div>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Tomato plants can take anywhere from 45 to 70 days to reach maturity. The size of the ripe tomato is usually proportional to the number of days to harvest, with smaller tomatoes taking less time to grow than larger tomatoes. As a result, smaller varieties of indeterminate tomatoes can have a long harvest time, producing tomatoes as early as seven weeks after planting and into fall.
